STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1: Go to the official MySQL website: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

STEP 2: Click on the MySQL Community Server link.

STEP 3: Choose the appropriate version for your system (e.g., macOS 15 ARM64) and download the installer.

STEP 4: Run the installer and follow the steps until the installation is successfully completed.

STEP 5: Open System Preferences and check if MySQL appears. You should see an option to Start or Stop MySQL Server â€“ this means it is installed.

STEP 6: Open the Terminal and run the following command to locate the MySQL binary:

    sudo find /usr/local -name mysql

STEP 7: Once you find the path (e.g., /usr/local/mysql-9.3.0-macos15-arm64/bin/mysql), run:

    /usr/local/mysql-9.3.0-macos15-arm64/bin/mysql -u root -p

You'll be prompted to enter your password. If successful, you should see:

    mysql>

You're now working inside the MySQL shell!

OPTIONAL: Create your own database and tables

MySQL includes default system databases like mysql, information_schema, etc.
If you want to create your own database:

    CREATE DATABASE test;
    USE test;

Now create your tables!
