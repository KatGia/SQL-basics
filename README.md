## Introduction: What Is SQL and Why Use It?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a powerful tool for data analysis, alongside **Python** and **R**. Each language has its unique strengths, and the best choice depends on your project's requirements and your personal skills.

## Focus on SQL

### Key Features

* **Designed for Relational Databases**: SQL works with structured data organized in tables.
* **Direct Queries**: Write commands to retrieve, filter, and summarize data efficiently.
* **Optimized Performance**: Handles large datasets with speed and precision.
* **Simple Syntax**: Easy to learn and use—even if you're not a programmer.

### What Is a Relational Database?

A **relational database**:

* Organizes data into **tables** (rows = records, columns = fields)
* Connects tables through **primary keys** and **foreign keys**
* Enables complex data management and queries

> **Example**: A database for RNA-seq experiments might have tables for samples, sequencing results, and metadata — all linked through relationships.

## What Can You Do with SQL?

With SQL, you can:

* **Manipulate Data**: Modify and aggregate data as needed.
  *Example: Filter gene counts to create a subset matching patients in a survival study.*

* **Query Data**: Search for specific information, including complex nested queries.

* **Define Database Structure**: Create tables and set relationships that reflect your data model.

* **Control Access**: Manage permissions to protect and share your data securely.

## Summary: When to Use Each Language

| Language   | Best Use Case                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL**    | Querying and managing structured data in relational databases (e.g., biomedical datasets) |
| **Python and R** | Data analysis and visualization, automation, machine learning, statistical modeling |
