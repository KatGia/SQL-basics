## Introduction: What Is SQL and Why Use It?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a powerful tool for data analysis, just like **Python** and **R**. Each language has its own strengths, and the best choice depends on the project’s needs and the user’s skills.

## Comparing SQL, Python, and R

| Language | Strengths | Best Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **SQL** | - Designed for relational databases<br>- Direct data querying<br>- Efficient with large datasets<br>- Simple, readable syntax | When you need to **extract, filter, or aggregate** data directly from a database |
| **Python** | - General-purpose programming<br>- Powerful libraries (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn)<br>- Easy SQL integration | When you want to **analyze, transform, or model** data flexibly |
| **R** | - Specialized in statistics<br>- Advanced packages (dplyr, ggplot2)<br>- Excellent for data visualization | When you need **statistical analysis** or **scientific plotting** |

## Focus on SQL

### Key Features
- **Built for Relational Databases**: SQL is specifically designed to query and manipulate data stored in structured tables.
- **Direct Queries**: Allows users to write commands to retrieve, filter, and summarize data.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for reading and writing large datasets.
- **Ease of Use**: SQL syntax is relatively simple and intuitive, even for non-programmers.

### What Is a Relational Database?
A **relational database**:
- Organizes data into **tables** (rows = records, columns = fields)
- Links tables through **primary keys** and **foreign keys**
- Enables efficient data management and complex queries

> Example: A database storing RNA-seq experiments might include tables for samples, results, and metadata — all connected through relationships.

## What Can You Do with SQL?

In summary, you use SQL statements to:

- **Manipulate Data**: Modify and update data using aggregation or set operators.  
  _Example: Filter gene counts into a new table to match only the patients included in a survival analysis._

- **Query Data**: Check for the presence of specific information using queries, including nested queries.

- **Define the Database**: Create the structure of the database and its tables, so you can later use relationships between them to retrieve the information you need.

- **Control Access**: Define who can view or modify the data in the database.

## Summary: When to Use Each Language

- **SQL**: Best for querying and managing structured data in relational databases (e.g., biomedical datasets, experimental results).
- **Python**: Great for data analysis, automation, and machine learning.
- **R**: Ideal for statistical modeling and high-quality data visualization.
