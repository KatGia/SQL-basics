### Step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1:** Go to the official MySQL website: [https://www.mysql.com/downloads/](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

**Step 2:** Click on the **MySQL Community Server** link.

**Step 3:** Choose the appropriate version for your system (e.g., `macOS 15 ARM64`) and download the installer.

**Step 4:** Run the installer and follow the steps until the installation is successfully completed.

**Step 5:** Open **System Preferences** and check if MySQL appears. You should see an option to **Start** or **Stop MySQL Server** â€“ this means it is installed.

**Step 6:** Open the **Terminal** and run the following command to locate the MySQL binary:

```bash
sudo find /usr/local -name mysql
```

**Step 7:** Once you find the path (e.g., `/usr/local/mysql-9.3.0-macos15-arm64/bin/mysql`), run:

```bash
/usr/local/mysql-9.3.0-macos15-arm64/bin/mysql -u root -p
```

You'll be prompted to enter your password. If successful, you should see:

```
mysql>
```

You're now working inside the MySQL shell!

### Optional: Create your own database and tables

MySQL includes default system databases like `mysql`, `information_schema`, etc.
If you want to create your own database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_caterina;
USE test_caterina;
```

Now create your tables!
